# Quantifying Neural Foundations of Consciousness


## Project Overview

This research project focuses on developing analytical frameworks to analyze large, raw, spontaneous brain signals using custom Python functions. The framework integrates various statistical tests and machine learning models to classify data based on specific properties, particularly targeting artificially induced states of consciousness and the classification of different drugs.

Key contributions include:

- **Framework Development**: Creation of tools to handle and analyze complex brain signal datasets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Utilization of complexity measures derived from dynamic brain activity as input features to enhance model performance.
- **Drug Classification**: Building machine learning models to classify various drugs based on their effects on brain activity.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluation of different complexity measures to identify the most effective one for distinguishing between states of consciousness.

Ultimately, this project aims to advance our understanding of the neural foundations of consciousness and the impact of different drugs through innovative data science approaches.
